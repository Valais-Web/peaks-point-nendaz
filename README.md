**Peaks Point** is a premium, locally based property management brand focused on Nendaz and the Valais Alps.

The project represents the foundation of a modern, owner-first approach to property management, combining local presence, full delegation, and performance-driven rental strategies. Peaks Point is designed for property owners who want to generate income from their assets without dealing with the operational burden of day-to-day management.

The company provides end-to-end services covering short-term rentals, long-term rentals, chalet management, concierge services, and homecare. Every property is managed with a clear objective: protect the asset, optimise annual revenue, and remove all friction for the owner.

This repository contains the initial version of the Peaks Point website, built to establish a professional online presence, communicate the brand’s positioning, and begin ranking locally for owner-focused property management services in Nendaz. The website is bilingual (French and English) and structured around clarity, trust, and proximity rather than marketing hype.

Peaks Point positions itself as a long-term partner for property owners, acting as a single point of contact and a trusted steward for real estate assets in an alpine environment with strong seasonality. The emphasis is on sustainable performance, transparency, and peace of mind.
